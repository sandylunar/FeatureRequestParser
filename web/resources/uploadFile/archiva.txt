title=Allow different implementation of transfer mechanism in the DefaultRepositoryProxyConnectors class
want=We would like to use a different implementation for transferring an artifact from the remote proxy. 
explanation=This particular remote proxy we have is not Maven repository. 
want=Our transport library handles the bridging work so we would like to use it instead of the default implementation using Wagon.
explanation=Could you make a change in the DefaultRepositoryProxyConnectors so that it can be extendable? 
explanation=We would just want to override the transport method which uses Wagon.
want=Please take a look at the submitted patch.
useless=Thanks.


title=Add description field to the different types of repositories
want=When looking over the repositories page it would be useful to have a description for each of the repositories configured. 
want=Psonally I need it to be able to describe the owner of the repository and indended purpose.


title=ability to use file protocol using UNC path for Managed repository
explanation=Currently, if I try to use a network share with a UNC path when creating a Managed Repository, the path is replaced with a newly created directory on the system root. 
example=For example, using the path of file:/\\path_to_network_share gets changed to file:/C:/path_to_network share. 
explanation=I have tried a combination of strings for the url but have not been able to connect to a network share.


title=Ability to delete an artifact from the web interface 
want=Sometimes when viewing an artifact through the Archiva Web UI, I'd like to delete it from the repository.
drawback=Currently the only way to do this by deleting it from the managed repository filesystem.


title=Allow uploading multiple artifacts
explanation=Just a suggestion. 
drawback=In cases like uploading 10 or more artifacts, it's hassle uploading 1 artifact at a time.


title=Add the possibility to schedule retrieve remote indexes when application startup
want=When Starting Archiva, it would be nice to retreive all remote indexes that are checked to be used for remote repository before activating the automatic retreive actions.
want=Idealy a parameter would be nice to all download on startup.


title=downloading (optionnaly) remote index to display remote artifacts in search results
explanation=if a managed repo has remote repos, artifacts are available but not display in a search result.
explanation=configure an optionnel remote index url
explanation=running this download in a configurable schedule


title=search on artifacts with OSGI Metadatas fields
explanation=Ability to search on some OSGI metadatas symbolic-name, version, export-packages.
example=See improvmenents in maven-indexer MINDEXER-36
want=Need an update of maven-indexer.


title=monitor repository scanning progress
drawback=currently it's hard to tell where a repository scanning task is up to. 
want=Even though the percentage completion may not be easy to estimate, we can assess how many files have already been processed.


title=Web services for editing a managed repository
drawback=Currently, we only have web services for add, delete and retrieve of managed repositories.
want=This should also show up in the audit events and audit log report, and must be indicated that it was done remotely.


title=Web services for repository merging or artifact promotion
want=I think CRUD for managed repositories should be a pre-requisite of this.


title=Add support for NPanday artifact types
explanation=NPanday (<URL>) declares a number of new artifact handlers that Maven can use as extensions to be able to deploy dotNET artifacts into a repository. 
want=There should be an Archiva plugin that can recognise these types for path conversion so that they can be uploaded through the web form, and viewed in the artifact information page correctly.


title=Proxy should work transparently with either maven 1.x or 2.x repositories.
explanation=Have the maven-proxy act as either a maven 1.x or maven 2.x repository, depending on which client accesses it. 
want=Brett believed this should be managable with aliasing.
explanation=This was originally posted as a maven-proxy feature at <URL>


title=caching repository query interface
want=need to be able to query the repository to see if artifacts exist, what versions are available, etc. 
want=This needs to interoperate with the indexing, and where applicable should cache information, balancing the need to keep a low memory overhead but avoid repetitive disk reads on metadata files.


title=utilise repository relocation information during conversion of an artifact
want=we should allow some extra metdata in the m1 pom that can be recognised as relocation information: <CODE>
explanation=when encountering this, the converted POM and JAR will go to the new location in the m2 repository, 
explanation=and the marker POM (just the relocation information) should go to the old location (and any artifact there should be removed)
example=This would allow us to move Jakarta commons en mass to the dotted groupId layout for example.


title=repository: transitive dependency report
want=repository tool to ensure that transitive dependencies will work.
explanation=we basically need to know that every artifact that is referenced in one POM is actually in the repository along with its POM. 
want=We need to know that the dependency relationships among all artifacts in the repository form a closed set. 
want=otherwise the transitive dependency mechanism in m2 will break and we need to be wary of this. 
want=eventually i would like to create graphical representations of the dependencies amongst projects but this can come later.


title=LDAP Support and Documentation
want=It would be very nice to integrate with our corporate LDAP rather than maintain a separate User DB for authentication.


title=Add remote repository health check
explanation=A cron based check of remote repositories (cron value per remote).
explanation=Option:<LIST>


title=using LDAP can be configurable with the ui
explanation=currently to use ldap users/admin must edit a configuration file and restart their instance.
want=This must be configurable with the ui.


title=download artifacts when coming from search results
explanation=Search is based on maven index. 
explanation=Users can have results for artifact not here.
explanation=So going to artifact info display an empty result.
want=We must download artifacts.


title=Upload (deploy) artifacts to a repository - via a web form (not using wagon)
want=The web interface should allow to upload artifacts to the repository. 
drawback=For M1 one could just ftp the artifacts as needed but with M2 having to go through the file:deploy plugin is a pain. 
benefit=Archiva could help a lot here


title=ability to have multiple reports
explanation=currently the reports are all aggregated into one representation and execution. 
want=It should be possible to have separate groups, with just the health ones tied to the indexing and the others run on demand.


title=add user management and basic security
explanation=this issue just needs the ability to create and manage users and groups, log in, and restrict access to the administration interface. 
want=Further operations may add the need for more security later on.


title=web service interface
explanation=this needs a new jira component.
want=We need a comprehensive web services interface to the application. 
example=Like RSS, it should be a new view on the same actions. 
want=The more we can derive that from the repository-core interfaces, the better.
want=This should include administration and security.


title=create a second index with a subset of information, and have it compressed
explanation=required for the eclipse plugin. 
explanation=Will need to follow up with Jason on exactly what data is required.


title=Repository Manager should have a means to remove old snapshot builds
want=A nice feature for the MRM to have would be a way to set rules on when older SNAPSHOT builds of the form <CODE> should be removed from the repository. 
explanation=This could either be time based (for example any builds older than a month) or count based (for example keep only the newest 5 builds).
explanation=In addition to the artifact itself, md5 and sha1 files should also be cleaned out.


title=Delete more then one Artifact at once
want=As suggested by Wendy <URL> I open this issue to keep track on the feature of bulk delete actions on artifacts. 
want=As described in <URL>:"Imagine I would like to remove <CODE> and all its children/subprojects (that are referenced as modules in the parent)."
want=It would be nice to have form that allow to only specific the package and then delete everything below it.


title=Add artifact search box to the default decorator
want=Add artifact search box to the default decorator.
want=Being able to search from every page highlights the improved search for 1.2 and reduces the amount of clicks to get to the quicksearch page.


title=add RSS view to repository manager
explanation=possibly needs a new component in JIRA. 
explanation=Items that could have RSS:<LIST>


title=add a background task scheduler
want=we need to be able to schedule tasks. 
want=We should use quartz, and reuse code from Continuum that does similarly.
explanation=There needs to be a way to add/remove/configure scheduled tasks such as indexing, report execution and syncing


title=Ability to merge repositories
want=Need to be able to merge one repository into another, updating metadata and not overwriting existing artifacts.
want=The source repository should remain unchanged.
want=It should produce output listing what was merged and what wasn't.
want=Additions to the target repo should show in the audit log.
example=Related thread: <LINK>


title=Provide 302 redirect for latest SNAPSHOT
want=It would be very useful to have a single link that would always give you the latest snapshot jar, for example: <LINK>
explanation=Right now this is 404 because there's no file called <FILE>; 
example=instead, it has a specific jar file with a versioned name, for example <FILE>. 
benefit=It would be handy if Archiva recognized the URL above and provided a 302 redirect to the current latest deployed snapshot.


title=Virtual repositories or repository grouping
explanation=A number of managed repositories can be grouped together with that group having only one url. 
explanation=So you only need to specify that url in the <FILE> file and when Archiva receives a request via that url, it would look for that artifact from the repositories belonging to that group.
example=More details are dicussed here: <LINK>


title=Project Tree view 
want=Similar to the Dependency Tree tab, it would be nice to see a Project Tree showing the pom hierarchy (parent-and-modules) with links.
explanation=The data should be available in plain text as well (xml through the xmlrpc interface?)


title=Support inclusion of pom file when deploying an artifact via the web upload form
drawback=Currently the web upload form only supports pom generation when uploading M2 artifacts.


title=Repository purge feature for snapshots
want=We need a way to purge a repository of snapshots older than a certain date, (optionally retaining the most recent one) and fixing the metadata.


title=complete the proxy interface
drawback=the current proxy interface is not well integrated and the tests are failing. 
explanation=Complete this integration.


title=Add basic managed repository management support on adding repository, deleting repository, and loading repository by id
want=Add basic managed repository management support like adding repository, deleting repository, and loading repository by id.
explanation=The add repository can take the following parameters:<LIST>
explanation=deleting and loading a repository can take repository id as parameter.


title=Switch for disabling user registration
want=It would be nice to have a single switch to disable the registration of arbitrary users, so new users can only be registered by the administrator.


title=Adding a find jar by checksum functionality to the REST api
explanation=In 1.3.x versions, an applet gave us the possibility to know if a jar (on our local disk) was already in the repo, using the checksum files.
want=I would like to have this useful functionality back in v2.x,, but through a REST service : I provide a checksum code, and I get the list of artifacts that correspond to this checksum.
useless=Thanks !


title=Show Job Status / Whats going on behind the scenes
want=It would be nice to see whats going on in the background, without always looking into the log. 
explanation=Maybe a Log Viewer or such.
benefit=When adding a new task like scanning a repo, it would be also nice to get a percentage display or at least to see "ok, currently i am scanning repo X and have X mb downloaded" or such.


title=validator: report if artifacts are out of place
want=report if artifacts are out of place. 
explanation=you can tell this because in m2 the POM is packaged with the artifact in <FILE-PATH> so with that information you can assess weather the artifact is in the right location. 
explanation=this should not happen if tools are being used to deploy but it would be a good check to have.
