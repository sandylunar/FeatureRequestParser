mopidy 
Switch to setting up logging on mopidy logger instead of root
We should switch to using the mopidy logger to setup our logging, leaving the root handler with a null handler. Goal should be something like:<list>.Advantage of this would be that we no longer need to actively suppress pykka, ws4py, cherrypy, etc, logging.




if(want=0) 合并同类项

if(want=1) 已有

if(want>1)

	split by block
	if block =1
		do(split by want)
	if block >1
		for each block
			if block中不含有want，就近合并(先上后下)

		for each block
			do(split by want)

do(split by want): list[]={XX,XX,XX,XX..}
首个XX属于下一个want，其他XX属于上面的一个want

case:
wantXXwant => wantXX, want
wantXXwantXX => wantXX,wantXX
wantwant => want,want
XXwantXXwantXX => XXwant, XXwantXX
